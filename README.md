## 2023

It is almost the end of the year. Review this year, we got industrial Layoff again. 
I was impact by the movement, and lost my job at Slate Technologies, and joined Intuit.

I was pretty lucky that join the Intuit Futures team, which is similar to X at Google. 
I went trought the GenAI/LLM revolution, and completed Gen Studio project with the team.
With the project, I joined another team at Intuit focusing on Model Training pipline tool.

The team was great, however, due to long waitting of converting, I was facing the income situation, 
so at the end of the year, I started looking for new oppotunities and joined startup project teams
including FinAI, Traidin and Alum. However, none of them could have quick funding. Fortunatly,
I got offer from Meta, and started working on Privacy related project.

Privacy is defenitly important nowadays, especially many companies actually using "public" data
to train their model. There might be some legal suits, but it seems we have some tolerant on 
copyrights related fighting. None of them I have heard got fine.

I would continue working on AI domain and supporting Meta on privacy related projects.
At the same time maintaining existing business until they got mature. 

Wish next year, would be a better year.

tech limit. It was a great experience.
